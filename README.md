Aim
To design and implement a speed control system for a separately excited DC motor using a TIVA C Series microcontroller, enhancing the motor's performance and efficiency in various applications.

Objectives
Understanding Motor Characteristics: To analyze the characteristics of separately excited DC motors, including torque, speed, and operational limits.
Microcontroller Familiarization: To become proficient in programming and interfacing the TIVA C Series microcontroller.
PWM Control Implementation: To implement Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for speed control of the DC motor.
Feedback Mechanism: To incorporate a feedback system (e.g., tachometer) for real-time speed monitoring and adjustment.
Testing and Validation: To conduct tests for validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the speed control system.
